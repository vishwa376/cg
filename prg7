Write a Program to read a digital image. Split and display image into 4 quadrants, up, down, right and left

import cv2

# Function to split the image into four quadrants: up, down, left, and right
def split_image(image):
    height, width, _ = image.shape
    half_height = height // 2
    half_width = width // 2

    # Split the image into four quadrants
    upper_half = image[:half_height, :]
    lower_half = image[half_height:, :]
    left_half = image[:, :half_width]
    right_half = image[:, half_width:]

    return upper_half, lower_half, left_half, right_half

# Function to display images
def display_images(images, window_names):
    for img, name in zip(images, window_names):
        cv2.imshow(name, img)
    print("Press any key to terminate.")
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Read the image
image_path = "city.jpg"  # Replace "city.jpg" with the path to your image
image = cv2.imread(image_path)

if image is None:
    print("Failed to load the image.")
else:
    # Split the image into quadrants
    upper_half, lower_half, left_half, right_half = split_image(image)
    # Display the quadrants
    display_images([upper_half, lower_half, left_half, right_half], ["Upper Half", "Lower Half", "Left Half", "Right Half"])
